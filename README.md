## Hi there 
i recently made Library Management System using Python.
This is a simple Library Management System built using basic Python. It lets users store and manage books, add members, borrow and return books, and save data using text files. It's a command-line program designed to help practice core Python skills.

What This Project Can Do
1. Add new books with title, author, and ISBN.
2. Search books by title or author.
3. Add members to the system.
4. Borrow and return books.
5. Save all data to text files so nothing is lost when you close the program.

I used what i learnt in 3 days of learning python:
Python functions, Dictionaries and lists, If-else conditions and loops and very basic of file handling

Files in the Project
1. library.py – The main program file
2. books.txt – Stores all book records
3. members.txt – Stores member names and borrowed books
These files are created automatically when the program runs.
